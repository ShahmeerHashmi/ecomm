Hekto Marketplace – Day 3 Developer Report
API Integration & Data Migration

Overview
Today, I focused on integrating external APIs into Hekto and migrating the fetched data into our Sanity CMS. The goal was to ensure our product catalog is always up-to-date with real-world data, and to streamline our data ingestion process. This report documents my journey, the challenges I encountered, and the solutions I implemented.

What I Aimed to Achieve
Seamless API Integration:
Retrieve up-to-date product and category data from a designated external API.

Data Migration to Sanity CMS:
Transform the API data to match our existing schema and import it into Sanity.

Schema Validation and Adjustment:
Ensure that the incoming data aligns perfectly with our current schema, modifying the schema where necessary.

My Process
1. Reviewing the API Documentation
I began by thoroughly reviewing the API documentation for the external furniture product data source. Key endpoints such as /products and /categories were identified. This step was crucial to understand the data structure, field names, and types provided by the API.

2. Schema Mapping and Adjustments
After reviewing the API, I compared the provided fields with our existing Sanity CMS schema. For example, I mapped the API’s product_title to our schema’s name field.
Challenges:

Some fields had different naming conventions.
The API included additional data (like dimensions and material) that our initial schema did not account for.
What I Did:
I updated our schema to include these new fields, ensuring that every piece of data from the API could be accommodated. This adjustment was critical to maintain data integrity and provide a richer product display.

3. Developing Migration Scripts
I wrote a set of Node.js scripts to automate the process of fetching and transforming the data.
Steps Taken:

Fetching Data:
I created utility functions that made HTTP requests to the API, fetching product and category data.

Data Transformation:
The raw API data was then transformed to fit our Sanity schema. I paid close attention to type conversions and nested data structures.

Importing into Sanity:
Finally, the transformed data was imported into our Sanity CMS using their import tools.

Challenges Faced:

Data inconsistencies: Some API responses had missing fields or unexpected formats.
Performance: Initial tests showed slow data import times for larger datasets.
Solutions:

I implemented validation checks within the migration script to log and skip over incomplete records.
I optimized the script by batching API calls and using asynchronous processing to speed up the data import process.
4. Integrating API Calls into Next.js
To ensure that the frontend reflected these changes:

I added helper functions in our Next.js project to call the updated API endpoints.
I modified our product listing and detail pages to fetch and render data from Sanity dynamically.
Challenges:

Handling error states: Ensuring that if the API failed, the user wouldn’t be met with a blank page.
What I Did:
I introduced fallback UI elements like skeleton loaders and user-friendly error messages.

5. Testing and Debugging
I rigorously tested every part of the process:

API Testing:
I used Postman to validate API responses and confirm the integrity of the data being fetched.
Data Validation:
I checked that the data in Sanity matched what was expected, both in structure and content.
Frontend Testing:
The Next.js components were tested to ensure that they correctly rendered the new data, and that error handling worked as expected.
Reflections and Lessons Learned
Importance of Schema Flexibility:
I learned that having a flexible schema in Sanity is crucial when dealing with external data sources that may evolve over time.

Error Handling is Key:
Robust error handling and logging were essential in identifying and resolving issues during both API integration and data migration.

Performance Optimization:
Batch processing and asynchronous handling significantly improved the performance of data migration, which is something I’ll continue to refine in future iterations.

Final Outcome
Updated Sanity CMS:
The CMS now contains enriched product data, including additional fields like dimensions and materials.

Functional Frontend Integration:
The Next.js application successfully displays the updated product listings, complete with new data points, and gracefully handles API errors.

Reliable Migration Process:
The migration scripts run efficiently and include comprehensive validation and error logging.
